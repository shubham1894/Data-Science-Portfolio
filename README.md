# Data-Science-Portfolio
Portfolio of Data Science Projects for Academic and Self learning purpose. These repository consist of various project based upon Machine Learning, 
Data Visualization and Data Analysis.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Bot Prediction](https://github.com/shubham1894/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/bot-prediction/BotTraining.ipynb): Building a Model that can detect 
the Non Human Traffic present on a website. This model is based upon Classification problem on Supervised Machine Learning to predict weather the traffic 
occur on any perticular website is Bot or not. The competency challenge is hosted by AlmaBetter on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bot-prediction).

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- __Python__
		- [Analysis on Zomato Datasets](https://github.com/shubham1894/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Zomato%20EDA.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis
on Zomato Datasets usings visualisations tools such as Matplotlib and seaborn. 

		- [Data Cleaning of IMDB Datasets](https://github.com/shubham1894/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/EDA%20Imdb%20Dataset/EDA_on_IMDB_Dataset.ipynb):
This datasets is primarily focused on how to deal with real world messy datasets using python programming and pandas.

		- [Atliq Hospitality Revenue Analysis using Pandas](https://github.com/shubham1894/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Atliq%20Hospitality%20Revenue/HotelBooking2.ipynb):
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India providing them insights from their historical data.As a strategic move, 
the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence”. I used various visulizing tool such as Pandas,Matplotlib and Seaborn in order to regain 
their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. This Challenge was hosted by [codebasic](https://codebasics.io/event/codebasics-resume-project-challenge).

	- __Tableau__
