# Data-Science-Portfolio
Portfolio of Data Science Projects for Academic and Self learning purpose. These repository consist of various project based upon Machine Learning, 
Data Visualization and Data Analysis.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Bot Prediction](https://github.com/shubham1894/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/bot-prediction/BotTraining.ipynb): Building a Model that can detect 
the Non Human Traffic present on a website. This model is based upon Classification problem on Supervised Machine Learning to predict weather the traffic 
occur on any perticular website is Bot or not. The competency challenge hosted by AlmaBetter on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bot-prediction).

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation

	- __Python__
		- [Analysis on Zomato Datasets](https://github.com/shubham1894/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Zomato%20EDA.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis
on Zomato Datasets usings visualisations tools such as Matplotlib and seaborn.
